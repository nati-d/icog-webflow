## Overview

This project consists of a simple web application with an index page and a profile page, designed to demonstrate fundamental web development principles, continuous integration, and code quality practices. The project uses HTML to create the structure of the pages, and GitHub Actions is utilized for automating workflows and ensuring that code follows best practices.

## Why I Did It

### 1. **Index Page and Profile Page**
   The index page serves as the landing page of the application, providing an overview of the app's purpose. It includes links to the profile page, which contains user-specific information. I created these pages to demonstrate basic HTML structure, including headers, footers, and navigation.

   - The **index page** provides an introduction to the project and includes a navigation menu to guide users to other parts of the application.
   - The **profile page** showcases how user data can be displayed and structured. It serves as an example of handling dynamic data (though for this simple version, itâ€™s static).

### 2. **HTML for Structure**
   HTML was chosen as the primary language for the page structure because it provides the simplest and most effective way to define the structure of the web pages. The markup language allows for easy implementation of common elements such as headings, paragraphs, tables, and forms.

   - **Semantic HTML** is used for clarity and accessibility, making it easier for both humans and machines (search engines, screen readers) to understand the content.

### 3. **GitHub Actions and Workflow**
   GitHub Actions was implemented to automate various tasks, such as linting, testing, and deployment. The workflow runs automatically whenever changes are pushed to the repository, ensuring the application is always up to date and that code quality standards are adhered to.

   - **GitHub Actions Workflow:** The workflow runs on every push or pull request to ensure that the code is linted and tested automatically.
   - The workflow helps in continuous integration by verifying that changes to the project do not break existing functionality and that the HTML code is following best practices.
   
### 4. **HTML Hint for Code Quality**
   HTML Hint is integrated as part of the workflow to automatically check the quality of the HTML code. It helps enforce coding standards and ensures the code is error-free and properly formatted.

   - This tool checks for common HTML mistakes, such as missing or unclosed tags, unnecessary attributes, or incorrect nesting. It helps improve code maintainability by catching issues early and ensuring consistency throughout the project.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the index and profile pages.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the CI/CD pipeline, including code quality checks and deployment.
- **HTML Hint**: For linting and ensuring the HTML code follows best practices.
